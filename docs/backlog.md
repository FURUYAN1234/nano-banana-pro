# Technical Backlog and Future Tasks

## Proposed for Next Version Upgrade

- [ ] **Split `src/App.jsx`**: The file exceeds 1430 lines and breaks the 500-line limit rule. Refactor into smaller components.
- [ ] **Enforce UTF-8 in scripts**: Verify and update Python/Node.js scripts to explicitly set UTF-8 encoding (grep check failed previously).
