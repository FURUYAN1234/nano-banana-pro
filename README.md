# Nano Banana Pro Powered Super AI 4-koma System

**Autonomous AI Manga Generation Protocol**  
*Powered by Google Gemini 2.0 & Imagen 3*

## 🚀 Overview

**Nano Banana Pro Powered Super AI 4-koma System** is an experimental web application designed to push the boundaries of AI manga production. Leveraging the Gemini API (v1.5 Pro / v2.0 Flash), it autonomously handles scenario writing, storyboard composition, and final image generation for 4-panel manga (Yon-Koma).

Human intervention is minimized—the system aims for total "unmanned" creativity.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Automated Storytelling**: Generates Ki-Sho-Ten-Ketsu (Intro, Development, Twist, Conclusion) structures from a single topic.
* **Dynamic Visual Direction**: Automatically instructs camera angles (Worm's eye, Dutch angle) and composition.
* **Character Consistency**: Enforces strict adherence to character designs (hair, glasses, colors).
* **Copyright Safety**: Intelligent prompt sanitization to avoid infringing on specific trademarks while maintaining high quality.

## 📦 Usage

1. Run `start_app.bat` to launch the local server.
2. Open the displayed Local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).
3. Enter your Gemini API Key.
4. Enjoy the fully autonomous creation process.
